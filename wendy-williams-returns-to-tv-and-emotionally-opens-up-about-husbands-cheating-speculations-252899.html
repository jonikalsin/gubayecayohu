Today, the woman emerged – with a new look since she rocked a blond bob – and fans couldn’t be more excited to see her!</p><p>But as she greeted the audience, Wendy was obviously very emotional.</p><p>She was fighting tears and clenching her hands together, and took a few deep breaths before she addressed the rumors that her husband had cheated on her by first acknowledging that ‘apparently I’m a hot topic!’</p><p>She started her monologue by thanking fans for waiting for her all this time and proceeded to explain why it took her so long to return.</p><p>During her vacation, things started getting worse health-wise, and the host got into detail about the whole thing.</p><p>Fortunately, she was happy to tell her audience ‘that I am doing well,’ now.</p><p>Wendy was proud to say that these days, she really takes care of herself – always taking her medication, meditating, and exercising every single day for two hours!</p><p>Her time away was also an opportunity to focus on herself, but also spend time with her family.</p><p>Speaking of, she went on to address the cheating rumors surrounding her husband later on in the show.</p><p>‘I want to shout out to my husband. I’m still wearing my ring. Believe me you, when you’ve been with somebody for 28 years…married for 25 years…we know each other. He’s my best friend, he’s my lover, he’s all this and he’s all that. I know what you’ve been seeing and I know what the streets have been talking about.’</p><p>She assured everyone that she is still in love with him.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Wendy added that ‘Marriages are not easy. Don’t ask me about mine until you see this [ring] gone and it ain’t going anywhere—not in this lifetime.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGenmrulxYywoKWkmZa6tHnRnquuqp6oerW7jK2tZpmemXqmuc6toKimkaG5unnOqZynq12qvW6twaisrWWYqsCjrc2dqmabmJqutbXNoGSsqJWYwq2t06Kmp6tdZ4JzhJhyZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
