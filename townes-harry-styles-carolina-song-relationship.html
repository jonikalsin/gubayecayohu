However, they clearly didn’t stay incredibly close — he didn’t tell her about the song before he put out the album on May 12. Actually, it was when he performed the track on the&nbsp;Today Show May 9 that the girl&nbsp;first learned she’d inspired Harry to write a song. “The person who it’s about found out,” he explained in an interview. “I found out about how they found out that it was [on the record]. Their dad watches the&nbsp;Today show and he, like, left her a voicemail saying, ‘Uh I think he just sang a song about you on the TV.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>If Townes<i>&nbsp;</i>is the subject of “Carolina,” she clearly had&nbsp;a profound affect on Harry. He even sings in the song, “How would I tell her that she’s all I think about? Well, I guess she just found out,” and “I met her once and wrote a song about her, I wanna scream, I wanna shout it out, And I hope she hears me now.” Ummm…it’s safe to say she’s heard!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>These days, Harry is reportedly dating food blogger,&nbsp;<strong>Tess Ward</strong>, though, so it seems any chance of a relationship for him and Townes has long past. That won’t stop fans from being so incredibly jealous that Harry wrote a song about her, though!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, are you surprised that Harry has seen Townes since he wrote the song?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH12e5BuZq2np6OytHnHmqmrsV2owbq4xKxknJmipLmqusBmqqiml2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
