Flowers are blooming, plants are sprouting, and the feeling of new life positively fills the air. With terrible, allergy-inducing pollen. But, also with beauty and wonder!</span></p><p><span>The Epcot International Flower & Garden Festival has returned and will be delighting Guests with its displays from now until July 5. For a lot of folks, this is a bucket list experience–the chance to see the beautiful gardens and topiaries, not to mention tasting all the delicious food. It’s a not-to-be-missed event.</span></p><p><span>That said, if you can’t make it, don’t worry. There are plenty of lovely gardens to experience year-round in Walt Disney World. Let’s take a look at a few of our favorites.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrationspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/032822Canada.jpg alt width=600 height=425 sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3><b>The Victoria Gardens of Canada</b></h3><p><span>British Columbia’s Butchart Gardens are some of the most stunning in the world. For over 100, they have inspired visitors with their lush foliage and delicate blooms. They have even been named a National Historic Site of Canada.</span></p><p><span>For a small taste of the experience, Guests can stop by the Canada Pavilion in Epcot. Located near Le Cellier Steakhouse, the Victoria Gardens feature maple trees, shrubbery, rose bushes, and a tranquil pond, all accented by towering boulders and a cascading waterfall in the background.</span></p><p><span>Visiting it is a bit like stepping into an impressionist painting.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrationspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/032822Oasis.jpg alt width=600 height=425 sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><b>The Oasis in Animal Kingdom</b></h3><p><span>It’s easy to miss the beauty of the Oasis. It’s the first part of the park you encounter when gates open, and for a lot of visitors, it is simply something they rush through to get to the E-ticket attractions like Flight of Passage, Expedition Everest, or Kilimanjaro Safaris.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>However, if you take the time to explore this tropical wonderland, you’ll be richly rewarded. It positively overflows with life. In addition to the many animals that populate the area–such as the African Spoonbill, Hyacinth Macaws, White Ibis, and others—there are countless plants to see as you wander through the trails.</span></p><p><span>The sound of running water mingles with the ambient soundtrack that plays throughout the land, making it one of the most relaxing spots to visit in all of Walt Disney World.</span></p><p><span>Keep a special eye out for the epiphytes that grow here. They are peculiar plants, which require no soil to grow. You can see them growing on the rocks and trees.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrationspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/032822AK2.jpg alt width=600 height=399 sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><b>Discovery Island in Animal Kingdom</b></h3><p><span>The Tree of Life is the most iconic structure in all of Animal Kingdom, and you could spend days simply walking around its base and gazing up at the hundreds of animal carvings that cover it. But the pathways around the icon also provide a bit of their own beauty as well.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As you make your way around the tree, take time to look into the nearby waters. Lilly pads dot the surface, and if you are there during the right season, you’ll even catch a glimpse of the stunning water lilies that grow out of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrationspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/032822Tiki.jpg alt width=600 height=425 sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><b>The Birds of Paradise and Orchids in Walt Disney’s Enchanted Tiki Room</b></h3><p><span>No discussion of the flowers of Walt Disney World would be complete without a trip to the Tiki Room. After all, that’s where the birds sing words and the flowers croon.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>No, the Birds of Paradise and Orchids in the show aren’t real. But they are definitely some of the most talented plants you are ever likely to encounter. You can spot the orchids when they lower from the ceiling in their flower beds, and the birds of paradise stand in the corners of the room.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You’ll have to forgive us for this slightly fanciful entry, but seriously, where else but the Most Magical Place on Earth could you see a tropical bouquet capable of singing the Hawaiian War Chant?&nbsp;</span></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><b><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrationspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/032822MS.jpg alt width=600 height=425 sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></b></h3><h3><b>The Magic Kingdom Entrance</b></h3><p><span>The resort’s most famous flowers just might be found at the entrance to the Magic Kingdom. That’s where you’ll see a floral representation of Mickey Mouse. It’s impossible to miss. You encounter it before passing under the train station and onto Main Street USA. It’s one of the best photo opportunities in all of Walt Disney World, so be prepared for a crowd. The spot is so popular, that Disney has placed PhotoPass photographers in the area to help Guests capture the perfect picture. If you take advantage of this offering, you might just get a little extra magic in your snapshot.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrationspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/032822Land.jpg alt width=600 height=425 sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><b>Living with the Land in Epcot</b></h3><p><span>For the budding horticulturalist (heh…budding…see what I did there?) there’s nothing better than a trip on Living with the Land. The boat ride carries you through biomes that resemble the rainforest, prairies, and even desert.</span></p><p><span>As you make your way through the attraction, you’ll see banana trees, cacao, jack fruit, sunflowers, pumpkins, pomelo, marigold, snapdragon, and much, much more.</span></p><p><span>For folks particularly passionate about agriculture and gardening, the Behind the Seeds experience, which takes you on a guided foot tour of the facility, is one of the best values and most memorable experiences you can have while visiting the park.</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrationspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/032822BFLY.jpg alt width=600 height=425 sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><b>The Butterfly and Knot Herb Garden in Epcot</b></h3><p><span>Canada is not the only pavilion with a gorgeous garden in the World Showcase. While visiting the United Kingdom, you can stop by the Butterfly and Knot Herb Garden. There are numerous flowers that are placed to attract butterflies. You might even catch a few flitting about. In the herb garden, located near the replica of Anne Hathaway’s cottage, you’ll see things like parsley, sage, and rosemary.</span></p><p><span>While you’re there, it’s also worth taking a few minutes to meander through the nearby hedge maze. When you’re done, you might just feel like stopping for a spot of tea.&nbsp;</span></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrationspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/032822PAndora.jpg alt width=600 height=425 sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 600px, 100vw" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h3><b>Pandora: The World of Avatar in Animal Kingdom</b></h3><p><span>When you take a trip with Alpha Centauri Expeditions, you not only get the chance to encounter Na’vi culture but the exotic plant life that grows on Pandora. To make the land truly immersive, Imagineers filled it with a mix of real and fictional plants.</span></p><p><span>Along with the real shrubbery spotted throughout, you’ll see things like the Challis Plant, the blue Puffball plants, and, of course, the enormous Flaska Reclanata, the spitting plant encountered near the entrance to the land.</span></p><p><span>Visiting the area at night produces an entirely different experience, as many of the plants are bioluminescent, producing an ethereal glow that is like nothing you’ve ever seen before.</span></p><p><span>While these are far from the only beautiful landscapes and plant life in Walt Disney World (we didn’t even get to the gorgeous lobby of the Polynesian Resort) they are a few of our favorites. What are your favorite garden spots in the parks or on the property?&nbsp;</span></p><h3><strong>Enjoy the magic of Disney all year ’round with Celebrations Magazine!</strong></h3><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrationspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Celebrations-Issue-73.jpg alt width=227 height=298 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h4>1 year/$49.95!</h4><h3><a href=#><strong>Click here to order!</strong></a></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77AraCopqOlv6a%2F0meaqKVfZ31zfo5pamhqaGTBqbGMoJirnJWjwG6tzZ1kn6SfrLKzv4yonWavkaHBbrDIrKWesV2svLO4w2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
