Because of the Super Bowl logo color scheme conspiracy theory, of course!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the past few NFL seasons, football fanatics have dialed in on a theory that says the logo for the Super Bowl predicts which teams will go head-to-head in the Big Game, based on what colors make up the image.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Four teams remain in the running for the Super Bowl on Feb. 11 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas: the Kansas City Chiefs, Baltimore Ravens, Detroit Lions and the San Fransisco 49ers. And while the top two teams won't be decided until Jan. 28, when the Chiefs will take on the Ravens for the AFC title and the Lions will fight against the 49ers for the NFC win, fans are convinced that this year's logo predicts a Ravens/49ers match up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on to find out why, as well as everything to know about the Super Bowl logo color scheme conspiracy.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-the-super-bowl-logo-theory></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is the Super Bowl logo theory?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to this theory, the colors in the Super Bowl logo — designed well in advance of the game itself — predicts which teams will play against each other in the Big Game.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-did-the-super-bowl-logo-theory-begin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When did the Super Bowl logo theory begin?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Bengals and Rams play in Super Bowl LVI.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rob Carr/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This theory has held true over the past few years, and fans picked up on the Super Bowl logo color scheme trend in November 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The theory dates back to the 2022 Super Bowl logo, which corresponded with the season that saw the Cincinnati Bengals face off against the Los Angeles Rams.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The logo included a reddish-orange hue similar to that of the Bengals' team color, while also encompassing a yellow shade similar to the Rams' team color.

Eagle-eyed football fans noticed that the previous two logos had colors that were representative of the eventual main matchup, and thought this one might hold predictive powers as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">(The color scheme phenomena doesn't go further back, however, because <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>logos in the immediately preceding years </a>had been identical, with just the numbers changed.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Super Bowl LVI, which saw the Bengals against the Rams in February 2022, was the first Super Bowl to incorporate the new logo.
