However, the death was ruled a suicide and police moved on (per <a href=# rel=noopener>All That’s Interesting</a>). Puente spent three years in prison for the thefts. By 1985, she was free and on her way to opening her second boarding house (via <a href=# rel=noopener>Bustle</a>).

Per <a href=# rel=noopener>The Cinemaholic</a>, eventually, Dorothy Miller, Benjamin Fink, Leona Carpenter, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Bert Montoya</a> all went missing while living in Puente’s home. However, it would be Bert Montoya’s disappearance that would lead to the end of Puente’s house of horrors.
