Since her time in high school at Assumption High School, she has always displayed exceptional volleyball talents. Katie won the Prep Volleyball National Player of the Year award while competing for the school’s volleyball team.</p><p>She kept playing the game with a zest throughout college. Katie joined the University of Louisville and competed for the Louisville Cardinals women’s volleyball team.
