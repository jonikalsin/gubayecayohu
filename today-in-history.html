He was working in his lab in Wurzburg, Germany when he noticed a nearby screen that was coated in chemicals glowing as he tested whether the electron beams could pass through glass.

His studies won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901.</p><h2>1923: The Beer Hall Putsch Begins</h2><p>Adolf Hitler and other members of the Nazi Party attempted to lead a coup in Bavaria, Germany, in what’s known as the Beer Hall Putsch.

When the lies eventually unraveled, Pan decided to enlist the help of her boyfriend, Daniel Wong, to kill them.</p><p>In a panicked 911 call, Pan told police that intruders entered her home, tied her up, and shot her parents in the basement. Miraculously, Pan’s father survived the attack and told police that he heard his daughter speak to the intruders as if they were friends.
