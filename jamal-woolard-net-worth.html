His career has been active since the early 2000s.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Jamal Woolard is, as of late 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Woolard`s net worth is as high as $500,000, an amount earned through his career in the entertainment industry.</p><h3>Jamal Woolard Net Worth $500,000</h3><p>Jamal grew up in a part of Brooklyn called Lafayette Gardens; from his teen years, he started rapping under the name Gravy, but got into the spotlight in 2006, when he released his first mixtape, entitled “Who Shot Mayor Goonberg? Polotics As Usual Vol.1”. The same year he released two more mixtapes “Mayor Goonberg Visits Africa” and “The Come Up Mixtape”, which sales certainly increased his net worth. A year later, his fourth mixtape came out, entitled “N.Y. Target”, and in 2009 his last mixtape was released “Notorious Gravy”, which also added to his net worth.</p><p>However, he made even bigger success as an actor, when he was selected to play the role of Christopher Wallace, aka Notorious B.I.G in the film “Notorious” (2009), and he will also repeat his role in the film “All Eyez on Me” (2017), which chronicles the life of one more legendary rapper, <a href=#>Tupac Shakur</a>. His net worth is likely to grow considerably.</p><p>To speak further of his career as an actor, he appeared in the film “Dice City” (2013), and in 2015 he had two successful projects – “730” starring Stan J. Adams and Dionicio Chambers, and “Battle Scars” with such stars as <a href=#>Fairuza Balk</a>, Heather McCombs and Zane Holtz. Most recently, he appeared in “The Return” (2016), and “Barbershop: The Next Cut” as Marquis, alongside <a href=#>Ice Cube</a>, <a href=#>Regina Hall</a> and <a href=#>Anthony Anderson</a> among others, all of which contributed to his rising net worth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Jamal has a daughter, however, neither her age nor the name of her mother are known in the media. Regardless, he seems quite devoted to her, as he took time off from “the scene” to spend more time with her.</p><p>Back in 2006, Jamal was shot near radio station Hot 97, and immediately after the event he entered the station, as he had scheduled interviews; his wounds were not severe. Unfortunately, his music was banned from the station, due to the policy which dictates that rappers who have been involved in any altercation will be banned from the station.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=2.3706896551724><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>He played Biggie Smalls in both Notorious and All Eyez On Me.</td></tr><tr readability=2.7476635514019><td>2</td><td>Added over 50 pounds to his already large frame to play The Notorious B.I.G. in the film <a href=#>Notorious</a> (2009).</td></tr></table><p><a href=# class="shortc-button medium green"><span class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden=true></span> All pictures</a></p><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Never Heard</td><td>2017</td><td>post-production</td><td>Ronny</td></tr><tr><td>Doctor Impostor</td><td>2017</td><td>post-production</td><td>Dammon Simmons</td></tr><tr><td>Priest the Lost Son</td><td></td><td>announced</td><td>Priest / Kilo</td></tr><tr><td>All Eyez on Me</td><td>2017</td><td></td><td>Biggie</td></tr><tr><td>The Fearless One</td><td>2017</td><td></td><td>Stan</td></tr><tr><td>Barbershop: The Next Cut</td><td>2016</td><td></td><td>Marquis</td></tr><tr><td>The Return</td><td>2016/XI</td><td></td><td>Biggie</td></tr><tr><td>Battle Scars</td><td>2015/I</td><td></td><td>Dre</td></tr><tr><td>730</td><td>2015</td><td></td><td>P</td></tr><tr><td>Dice City</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Movie</td><td>Bubbie</td></tr><tr><td>Daisy and Ray</td><td>2011</td><td>Short</td><td>Malik</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Notorious</td><td>2009</td><td></td><td>Christopher 'Biggie' Wallace</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=8.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=15><td>Notorious</td><td>2009</td><td>performer: "Bed Stuy Brooklyn", "Every Day Struggle", "It's a Demo", "Pimps & Macs", "Party & Bullshit", "Juicy", "Unbelievable", "Warning", "Gimme the Loot", "Who Shot Ya", "The Breaks", "Sky's the Limit"</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Love Don't Cost a Thing</td><td>2003</td><td>writer: "Pass the Courvoisier Part 2"</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Producer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=producer readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Turnt</td><td>2017/I</td><td>Documentary executive producer</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Turnt</td><td>2017/I</td><td>Documentary</td><td>Rilla</td></tr><tr><td>Tavis Smiley</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Last Call with Carson Daly</td><td>2009</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr><td>The Come Up</td><td>2006</td><td>Video documentary</td><td>Himself (credit only)</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Nominated Awards <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table readability=1><tr><th>Year</th><th>Award</th><th>Ceremony</th><th>Nomination</th><th>Movie</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>2010</td><td>Black Reel</td><td>Black Reel Awards</td><td>Best Breakthrough Performance</td><td>Notorious (2009)</td></tr><tr><td>2009</td><td>BET Award</td><td>BET Awards</td><td>Best Actor</td><td>Notorious (2009)</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/salary.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/2946456_Jamal-Woolard/2946456_Notorious-2009.jpg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/2946456_Jamal-Woolard/2946456_All-Eyez-on-Me-2017.jpg><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqOYppmcYsSwu8uaqZ1lnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
