Agnes, a beloved mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother, leaves behind a legacy of love and cherished memories.</p><p>Born into the Fitzpatrick family, Agnes was a pillar of strength and a source of warmth for her children, Bryan, Sandra, Lee, and Paula. She also played a significant role in the lives of her grandchildren Kayleigh, Charlotte, Daniel, and Amy, and was blessed to witness the arrival of her great-grandson Freddie.</p><p>The removal of Agnes’s remains from her residence at 52 The Meadows, Randalstown, to St. MacNissi’s Church, Randalstown, is scheduled for Thursday at 4.30 pm. The Requiem Mass will take place on Friday, the 8th of December, at 12.00 noon, followed by interment in the adjoining cemetery. As the community gathers to bid Agnes farewell, prayers are offered for her soul, seeking the mercy of sweet Jesus.</p><p>Agnes’s passing is deeply mourned by her sorrowing sisters, Theresa and Anna, her brother Tom, as well as her sons and daughters-in-law. The wider family circle shares in this collective grief, as Agnes was not just a relative but a cherished member of the community.</p><p>In honoring Agnes’s memory, the family has requested that the house remain private during this difficult time. Instead of flowers, the family kindly asks for donations in lieu, which will go to Marie Curie NI. Contributions can be made through Marrions Funeral Directors, located at 12A Main St, Randalstown, BT41 3AB, or online at www.marrionsfuneraldirectors.co.uk/donations.</p><p>As the community comes together to remember and celebrate Agnes’s life, the love and support extended to the family during this time of grief serve as a testament to the impact she had on the lives of those around her. May she rest in peace.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaJmXo7K0edaio6WhkaLAbrvBoquumaKueqe70Z6tnqpdnrtuu9SrZKGdkafBbq3Gp5ysZaeeua21wKaqaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
