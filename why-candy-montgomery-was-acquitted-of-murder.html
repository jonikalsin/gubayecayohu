When the case went to trial in October of 1980, Montgomery and her defense team made the claim that it was Betty Gore who had initiated the attack. Montgomery told jurors that it was Betty who took the ax from the garage and first swung it at Candy, and she only struck back in self-defense after struggling to get the ax away from her.</p><p>Although the prosecutors contended that the 41 brutal blows, 28 of which were directed at Betty’s face and many of which were inflicted while she was still conscious, was clear overkill, Montgomery’s attorney had a self-defense justification lined up, via <a href=# rel=noopener>Oxygen</a>. They put a psychiatrist, Dr. Fred Fason, on the stand. Fason was also a clinical hypnotist who examined Candy Montgomery extensively, wrote <a href=# rel=noopener>Texas Monthly</a>.
