Though he would never get a college degree, his formative years also set the stage for what was to become an illustrious career. His success attracted major jobs in the comedy world, as he ended up writing for such high-profile shows as Saturday Night Live and the Tina Fey award-winning sitcom 30 Rock. He has had an incredible career in stand-up comedy, television, and film, which explains how he managed to rack up so much money over the years.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Current Net Worth</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2024, Hannibal Buress's net worth will be $5 million.
