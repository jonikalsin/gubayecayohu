But today, we’re not going to talk about his amazing design skills or his successful career in television. Instead, we’re going to delve into something a bit more personal – his love life. Is David Bromstad in a relationship? Let’s find out!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Is-David-Bromstad-in-a-Relationship-1-min-1024x580.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=David_Bromstad></span><strong>David Bromstad</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before we dive into his relationship status, let’s get to know David Bromstad a little better. David was born on August 17, 1973, in Minnesota, USA. He’s best known for his impressive work as an interior designer and a television personality. You might recognize him as the first-season winner of HGTV’s “Design Star.” But David’s journey to success was not always smooth. He started as a Disney illustrator and gradually made his way into the world of interior design, thanks to his incredible talent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/53b4052ff52e9842b76f4b8efad99560.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=David_Bromstad_Openness_About_His_Sexual_Orientation></span><strong><strong>David Bromstad</strong></strong> <strong>Openness About His Sexual Orientation</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One of the things that make David Bromstad a beloved figure is his openness about his sexual orientation. David is openly gay, and he came out to the public in 2013. It’s important to note that being open about one’s sexuality can be a personal and sometimes challenging decision, but David decided to share this part of his life with the world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=David_Bromstad_Previous_Relationship></span><strong><strong>David Bromstad</strong> Previous Relationship</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>David Bromstad’s love life has been a topic of curiosity for many of his fans. In the past, he was in a long-term relationship with someone named Jeffrey Glasko. David shared a sweet story about how they first met. It happened at Firestone in Orlando on Valentine’s Day during a single party. David had a crush on Jeffrey for a long time, but they had never been formally introduced. He once mentioned in a 2012 interview with South Florida Gay News, “We both were always in relationships, and then we were single, and we fell in love immediately. It was really cool.”</p><p>However, like many relationships, theirs also had its ups and downs. The two reportedly split up in 2015, and things took a legal turn when Jeffrey filed a lawsuit against David. He alleged that David “left him financially and emotionally devastated and revealed that David was caught up with the dark world of drugs and sex.” Fortunately for David, he was cleared of all charges, and the case was dismissed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/0133aae9c1b21421.webp><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=David_Bromstad_Current_Relationship_Status></span><strong><strong>David Bromstad</strong></strong> <strong>Current Relationship Status</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Now, the burning question remains: Is David Bromstad currently in a relationship?

In 2013, he faced backlash from some fans after collaborating with the Salvation Army to host the nonprofit’s Red Shield Redesign Bash. The Salvation Army has faced criticism from some LGBTQ+ activists for alleged discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p>David addressed the controversy at the time, saying, “I know why people are mad at me, and I’m OK with that. We knew it was going to be a little bit controversial with the Salvation Army, but we did some research, and we felt the Salvation Army was trying to clean up its act and make amends toward the LGBT community.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hnbgu.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/David-Bromstad-on-My-Lottery-Dream-Home-775x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=David_Bromstad_Age_and_Career_Achievements></span><strong><strong>David Bromstad</strong> Age and Career Achievements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>David Bromstad is currently 49 years old.
