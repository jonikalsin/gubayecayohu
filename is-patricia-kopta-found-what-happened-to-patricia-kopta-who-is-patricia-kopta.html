She earned her nickname from local residents. The Ross Township police reported that in 1999, Patricia was discovered in need of care and was taken to an adult care home where she was later diagnosed with dementia. Patricia refused to share any details about her life with the staff at the care home until her condition progressed, and she began to open up. Her husband, Bob Kopta, and her sister, Gloria Smith, expressed immense gratitude upon discovering that Patricia was found alive after 31 years. Bob shared that Patricia enjoyed ballroom dancing and worked as an elevator operator before her disappearance. The couple did not have any children together, and Patricia was a devout Roman Catholic whose religious fervor only grew stronger with time. She eventually claimed to be the mother of God and warned of a nuclear Armageddon. Patricia lost her job and spent her days warning people on the streets and in parking lots about the end of the world, which further cemented her nickname, ‘The Sparrow.’</p><h2 id=patricia_kopta_missing_person class=smooth-goto>Patricia Kopta Missing Person</h2><p>A woman who had been missing for 31 years and presumed dead has been found alive in Puerto Rico.
