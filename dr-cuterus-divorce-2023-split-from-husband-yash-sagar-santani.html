It was revealed that they had split up during a Q&A on Dr. Cuterus’s Instagram story.</p><p>Tanya answered Frank when a follower asked about contraceptives: “I am separated, so I don’t use the pills for contraception.” This surprising revelation has sparked a lively debate on Dr. Cuterus’s divorce on several social media sites, most notably Reddit. In the Q&A session, Dr. Cuterus spoke directly to her followers despite the lack of a thorough explanation.</p><p>Her response to a fan who asked about her marriage was, “I’m divorced.” She went on to say that before becoming public, she needed time to think things through. The absence of a thorough answer has increased fans’ and followers’ curiosity and conjecture. Curiosity around Dr. Cuterus’s relationship status has increased as a result of her choice to disclose such private information through her replies to fans’ questions rather than a dedicated article.</p><p>The reasons for the breakup are yet unknown. Fans are still waiting for updates or new information regarding the reasons for the breakup, but Dr. Cuterus is still concentrating on treating health issues and teaching her audience about a range of medical subjects.</p><h2>Dr. Cuterus’s Ex-Husband Yash Sagar Santani</h2><p>Dr. Cuterus’s ex-husband, Yash Sagar Santani, is a successful person in his own right.
