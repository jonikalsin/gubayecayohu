Post-op, his treatment included the use of steroids — and that, in turn, meant he gained around 100 pounds.</p><p dir=ltr>Fans did, of course, notice, and he was candid about the bullying: “I didn’t feel good or look good, and I took a tremendous backlash from fans who thought I was eating too much when it was the steroids that were blowing me up,” he explained.</p><p dir=ltr>It also hasn’t been the end of his health-related issues. Although he stepped away from Foreigner in 1990, he joined up with Mick Jones once again for a series of 40th-anniversary reunion shows. That wasn’t to be, though: Billboard soon reported (via <a href=# rel=noopener>Syracuse.com</a>) that Gramm had pulled himself from the show on doctors’ orders after being hospitalized for “severe respiratory infection, dehydration, and fatigue.”</p><p>At the time, Gramm was looking ahead to official retirement. When he spoke with <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Boom</a> in 2019, he said that although he was having a ton of fun reuniting with Foreigner, and performing on-stage again, “I’m in the process of winding down, and I’m at peace with it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKeuqLXCZpuerJGeubR5wJumrqxdm7yzscigpZ6qXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
