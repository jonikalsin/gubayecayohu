Though Neulander claimed the death was an accident, the revelation was preferred when the husband himself, was accused of killing his wife.</p><p>The spouse is stunned while the family attempts to continue, yet things simply don’t agree with nearby policing.</p><h2 id=where-is-robert-neulander-now>Where Is Robert Neulander Now?</h2><p>As said on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Distractify</a>, Robert is spending time in Elmira Correctional Facility in New York State.
