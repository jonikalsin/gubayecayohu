More of a friendship.”</p><p>Shore, who has been friends with Barrymore for decades and even babysat her when they were younger, proceeded to pour his heart out to his potential bride-to-be after she asked him pointedly what he’s afraid of.</p><p>“Well, I want to do it with the right person,” Shore said, adding that he was on the hunt for a “best friend.”</p><p>“That’s the most important thing,” he added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-03-at-31239-PM.jpg><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11>“Well, I want you to find that friend and companion that you never have sex with,” Barrymore responded, “and that you walk the dog and eat and hang out and — well, maybe occasional sex, but have the best friendship with.”</p><p>As the show came to an end, the “Encino Man” star then took the stage and turned the conversation back to his mother, who was one of Barrymore’s personal idols.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15>“What Drew doesn’t know is that my mother was not happy when you married Tom Green,” he said in reference to Barrymore’s yearlong marriage that ended in 2002. “And she said to me, she goes, ‘Pauly, Drew should marry you.’ “</p><p>Visibly stunned and confused, Barrymore, standing with the audience, retorted: “That’s how Mitzi felt?” Shore, laughing, answered, “No, that’s how I feel, too.”</p><p>Shore then got down on one knee and as Barrymore covered her face in amazement said, “And that’s why I came here tonight, on this glorious night, to present you with a ring.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/11/Screenshot-2023-11-03-at-31212-PM.jpg><p>Not sure if Shore was being serious or not, Barrymore asked: “Are you proposing, Pauly?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23>“I duly wed,” he replied, presenting Barrymore with a very large, jeweled ring. “Might as well, right?
