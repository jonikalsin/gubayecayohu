He is a retired professional football player who spent 16 years in the National Football League (NFL) as a safety with the Philadelphia Eagles and Denver Broncos. Currently, he works as an NFL analyst for ESPN.</p><p>According to authoritative sources, Brian Dawkins’ net worth is estimated to be as high as $18 million as of late 2016. Dawkins attended Jacksonville William M. Raines High School and later enrolled at Clemson University, where he pursued a career in football, playing for the college team. In the 1996 NFL Draft, he was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles as the 61st overall pick and embarked on his professional career.</p><p>Despite some notable career highlights and successful seasons with the Eagles, Dawkins and the team managed to reach the Super Bowl only once in 2004, narrowly losing to the New England Patriots. In 2008, his contract expired, and he subsequently joined the Denver Broncos, signing a significant five-year contract worth $17 million, which significantly contributed to his net worth. Despite enduring some injuries, Dawkins’ first season with the Broncos was the best of his career, recording impressive statistics before announcing his retirement in 2012.</p><p>After working as an analyst, Dawkins returned to the Eagles as a Football Operations Executive focused on player development. He resides in Voorhees Township, New Jersey, with his wife Connie Kerrin, and they have four children.</p><p>For more details about Brian Dawkins’ net worth and career, click on this link: [Brian Dawkins Net Worth](https://networthpost.org/brian-dawkins-net-worth/)</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Trademarks</li><li>Facts</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><h3>Related posts:</h3><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiZq6GRo3qlrdakoKerXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
