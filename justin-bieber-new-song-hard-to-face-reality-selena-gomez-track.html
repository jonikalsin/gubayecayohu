The song sounds a lot like what the title implies — his reality!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>“And it ain’t easy all alone, relationships over the phone, talking to your significant other all night long.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Is Justin referring to his often long distance relationship with Selena? We’re pretty sure they rack up some serious phone time as they are always on tour apart from one another.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>One of the lyrics that caught our ear was this little gem, which seemed to be directed right at Ms. Gomez: “now you’re standing in from of me, it hurts me to know that I LIED.”</p><h3>Justin Releases New Song ‘Hard 2 Face Reality’ — About Selena?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>He also posted a short two-minute clip of the song to his IG account which also sported a picture of Justin looking lonely and sad standing on top of a boulder in Central Park in New York City.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>He and Selena have been more down than up lately and the caption under the picture seemed to point that fact out: “<span>Was gonna wait to go to Central Park for when I proposed to my future wife but s**t — sometimes things change.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>On April 23 Selena “unfollowed” Justin along with many others on her social media accounts. So that has left us wondering if maybe the Biebs is feeling the pain of being cut off from his lady-love. And if that’s the case then the pain has definitely come out in song.</p><h3>Justin Bieber’s ‘Hard 2 Face Reality’ — Full Lyrics</h3><p id=content-paragraph-9>[Chorus: Justin Bieber]<br>Sometimes it’s hard to face reality<br>Even though you might get mad at me<br>Sometimes it’s hard to face reality</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]<br>Don’t be afraid to stand alone<br>Don’t be afraid to stand outside the door alone<br>I know it’s hard away from home<br>It ain’t easy all alone<br>Relationships over the phone<br>Talkin’ to your significant other all night long</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>[Chorus: Justin Bieber]</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>[Verse 2: Pooh Bear]<br>Should’ve been adjusted to my life<br>Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time<br>Now you’re standin’ right in front of me<br>It is mean and though, that life<br>Try to protect your feelins<br>Givin’ in between the lines<br>Hope your heart is totally healed and</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>[Chorus: Justin Bieber]</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>What do you think <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, was this new song directed towards Selena?
