This disparity is because the northern part of the break is older and partially filled in, according to Joseph Cook, a geologist with the Arizona Geological Survey (AZGS).</p><p>“Some areas are about 10 feet [3 meters] across and up to 25-30 feet [7.5 to 9 m] deep (tapering crack, narrowing with depth), while others are a narrow surface crack less than an inch across,” Cook told <a href=# rel=noopener>Live Science</a>. “These narrow sections sometimes have open voids underground, so a collapse of the overlying material is possible — this is how the deep open portions of the fissure formed.”</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arizona-earth-fissure-drone-big.jpg alt="Arizona Earth Fissure Drone Big" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/giant-crack-arizona-depth.jpg alt="Giant Crack Arizona Depth" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=social-callout>Like this gallery?<br>Share it:</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>Recent drone footage showed the crack's enormity.</span><span class=credit>Arizona Geological Survey</span> <span class=caption-body>In some spots, this Arizona desert crack was tens of feet deep.</span><span class=credit>Arizona Geological Survey</span><p class=social-callout>Like this gallery?<br>Share it:</p><img decoding=async alt="Arizona Earth Fissure Drone Big" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img///allthatsinteresting.com/thumb/630.501.allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/arizona-earth-fissure-drone-big.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Gigantic Two-Mile-Long Crack Spontaneously Opens In Arizona Desert View Gallery<p>Cook first discovered the fissure when he was playing around on Google Earth in December 2014.</p><p>"When I went out to map the fissure, I realized the fissure was much longer than what was apparent in the Google imagery, almost 2 miles [3 kilometers] long in total," Cook said. After mapping the fissure using GPS, the geological team went back for another look using a drone.</p><p>According to Cook, agricultural water withdrawal is what is causing the crack to grow. As water leaves the ground, a buried cavity eventually gets filled in with the land above it.</p><p>"We see earth fissures forming around the margins of these subsidence areas and along mountain fronts within the subsidence areas," Cook said, adding that Arizona is full of these cracks.</p><p>The AZGS is monitoring 26 locations with a total of 170 miles (275 km) of fissures. Cook expects them to keep growing, as the surface cracks are only the tip of the iceberg fissure heading beneath the ground.</p><p>"I am sure the length of this fissure will increase over time, we are only seeing the surface crack of what collapsed," Cook said, "the underlying fissure is longer."</p><p>Next, read about how an <a href=# rel=noopener>enormous sinkhole</a> swallowed up an entire street in Japan, before checking out these <a href=# rel=noopener>amazing pictures of a sinkhole</a> that ate $5 million worth of classic cars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonykvsCcomaZop7HsLrAZpueq5WnwQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZingBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
